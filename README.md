# Mapa Sector Agroalimentario

* This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

* To create the map, the [leaflet library](https://leafletjs.com) is used (in the case of this application, react-leafleat), so, in order to migrate the map, this library must be installed in the corresponding environment.

* To run the application locally, the following code must be run in the terminal, to download the dependencies and start de application.
	> npm install
	> npm start
